Language: [ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ English](https://github.com/m7rlin/DiscordWebhook), [ğŸ‡µğŸ‡± Polski](https://github.com/m7rlin/DiscordWebhook/blob/master/README.pl.md)

## Requirements

Software you need to have installed before you can use this project:

**Local or dedicated server:**

They work almost the same way.

- [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/) â€” v3 or [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org)

Then you need the right PHP version. Below v7 won't work.

- PHP â€” version 7.2.14+

## Installation

Download or clone the repository. Place the project in your server folder â€” `www` for WAMP and `http` for XAMPP (when not changed).

## Usage

Open your browser and type:

`http://localhost/DiscordWebhook/examples/send-message`

or

`http://localhost:80/DiscordWebhook/examples/send-message`

- `localhost:80` â€” host and the port that your server is listening on; it can be changed in server configuration
- `DiscordWebhook` â€” folder with the project
- `examples` â€” folder with all examples
- `send-message` â€” example folder; you can change the name of the folder and modify the URL
